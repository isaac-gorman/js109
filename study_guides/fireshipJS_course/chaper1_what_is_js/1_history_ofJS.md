### Lecture 1: The History of JavaScript

**ECMAScript's evolution over the last 25 years**

Q: What did JavaScript start off as?
A: Originally JavaScript was created as a prototype scripting language written by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the netscape browser under the name "Mocha". After being renamed to JavaScript, it was standardized by ECMA International as ECMA-262, or ECMAScript 1997. The organization in charge of maintain ECMAScript standard are known as TC-39.

Q: What is ECMAScript?
A: ECMAScript is the JavaScript standard. ECMA stand for European Computer Manufactures Association. ECMA is a private international non-profit standardization organization.

Q: What is ECMAScripts relationship with JavaScript?
A: JavaScript is just the implementation of ECMAScript.

Q: What is ES6?
A: ECMAScript 6 is the update of ES5 which was standardized in 2009.

Q: What are the various releases of ECMAScript?
A: ECMAScript has been standardizing and adding new features to JavaScript for over 25 years. Here are the releases:

- ES1 1997
- ES2 1998
- ES3 1999. The longest standing version of early JS.
- ES4 Never finalized.
- ES5 2009. Added JSON, strict mode, functional programming array methods, and more.
- ES6 2015. Added classes, promises, arrow functions, let/const, and much more.
- ES7, ES8, ES9 ESNext. Modern updates now being release annually.

Q: So who uses the ECMAScript standardization? How are developers able to use the latest ES# when they are updated?
A: The ES# is used by server side applications and browser vendors such as Google Chrome, Firefox Mozilla, Apples Safari, and Microsoft Explore as specification on how to correctly implement the JavaScript language. So developers who use JS do not have to implement JS themselves.The ES# standard assures consistency across platforms.

Q: Is there an analogy that can be used to describe the relationship between ecma-script and java-script?
A: Stay with me here... the relationship between ecma-script and js is similar to how the EPA The United States Environmental Protection Agency sets emission standards which limits the amount of amount of pollution a vehicle can emit. These EPA standards are then implemented by the car manufactures to assure their vehicles are not polluting over the standard.
