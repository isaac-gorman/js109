**Q: So what are scripting languages ... really?**
_A: Scripting languages are languages that have less access computers native abilities, this is because languages like JavaScript run on a subset of the original programming language that was used to write the engine that it runs on such as Google Chromes V8 engine written in C++. Limitations are by design, but for example scripting languages like JS is runs by being interpreted by a lower level language that does not give access to a computers files system. AKA scripting languages run within another program and programming languages are dependant of the exterior program. For example whenever I am writing in JS I am writing code that will target a software system such as a browser or server thanks to Node.js the systems such as the Google Chrome V8 engine or Node.js enable me to automate operations on their systems._
