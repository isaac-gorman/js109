## What is JavaScript?

**Q: What is JavaScript and what is it used for?**
_A: JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where as HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages. JavaScript is used to give web pages interactive elements that engage a user_

**Q: What is a _text-based programming language_?**
_A: A text-based programming language is a language that typed using a keyboard and stored as text files. In contrast there are languages such as graphical or visual languages that use drag and drop rather than typing._

**Q: What does JavaScript do?**
_A: JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much anything else_

**Q: What is a _scripting language_?**
_A: A scripting language is a programming language for a runtime system that automates the execution of tasks that execution of the task that would otherwise be preformed by a human operator. Scripting languages are usually interpreted at run time rather than compiled. Examples of scripting languages include Ruby, Python, and JavaScript._

**Q: What is the difference between scripting and programming languages?**
_A: Programming languages are generally compiled and create an executable files, whereas scripting languages are interpreted and do not create executable files. Programming languages are most often used to build things from scratch, whereas scripting languages can be used to combined existing component of module. The biggest difference here is that there is no compilation step in scripting languages are the language is interpreted at runtime._

**Q: So what are scripting languages ... really?**
_A: Scripting languages are languages that have less access computers native abilities, this is because languages like JavaScript run on a subset of the original programming language that was used to write the engine that it runs on such as Google Chromes V8 engine written in C++. Limitations are by design, but for example scripting languages like JS is runs by being interpreted by a lower level language that does not give access to a computers files system. AKA scripting languages run within another program and programming languages are dependant of the exterior program. For example whenever I am writing in JS I am writing code that will target a software system such as a browser or server thanks to Node.js the systems such as the Google Chrome V8 engine or Node.js enable me to automate operations on their systems._

**Q: So what is JavaScript and how does it work?**

- Well first of all there is no such thing as JavaScript
- ECMAScript defines the basic syntax of the language and it's core mechanism
- But JavaScript needs a standard library to be usable, and this is where things get complicated:
- These days there are two main flavors of JavaScript:
- - 1. JavaScript on the Browser:
- - 2. JavaScript on the Server:

- On the browser JavaScript is provided a bunch of utilities such as:
- - Modifying the DOM
- - Making network request (Fetch, XMLHttpRequest)
- - Managing Data (Web Storage, IndexedDB)
- - Doing audio and graphics rendering
- - Using web sockets
- - Touch events
- - Geo-location
- - and many many more ....

- Using JavaScript on the server using Node.js gives completely different tools to enable you to manage the computer directly such as:
- - Path OS
- - File System
- - Handle network resources (Net, URL, HTTP/2)
- - Create process

- With each case you access to a range of very different utilities and functionalities and do not have nothing in common at all.

- When using JavaScript on the server JavaScript actually functions very similarly to standard programming languages, but when JavaScript is used on the browser it behaves more like a standard scripting language
