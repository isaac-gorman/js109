// Q: What should I know before diving into the definitions of variable declaration, initialization, assignment, and re-assignment?

/*Review Q&A: 

  - Q: What is the JavaScript interpreter?
    - A: 

  - Q: What are variables?
    - A: Variables are containers for storing data (values).

  - Q: What are identifiers?
      - A: Variables need to be identified with unique names.

  - Q: What is the assignment operator?
      - A: "=" the assignment operators assigns values to variables.


  - Q: Recall what data types are.
      - A: Variables can contain all data types, primitives, objects, and functions.

*/

// Q: What is variable declaration?
/* Answer:
   - Variable declaration is when you first define a variable give it its name, and initialize it to a value.
*/
/*Textbook Definition:
   - Variable declaration is a statement that asks the JavaScript engine to reserve space for a variable with a particular name. 

   - Furthermore, the JS engine gives the option to specify an initial value for the variable.

   - There are several ways to declare variables, but the preferred way in modern JavaScript uses the `let` keyword.


*/
/*w3school Definition: 
  - Variable declaration is the the creation of a variable in JavaScript. 

*/
/*More Definitions: 
  - JavaScript includes variables which hold data value and that value can change over time.
  - JavaScript uses reserved keywords such as var, const, and let to declare a variable.

  Q: Can I use variables in JS before using them?
  - A: No. You have to declare variables "create them" before you can use them. The act of storing a value in variable is called "initialization"

  Q: How many ways can we declare a variable?
  - A: 3 ways using there different keywords:
       1. var
       2. let
       3. const
*/

// Q: What is variable initialization?
/* Answer:
   - variable initialization is when you first declare a variable and assign it a value. Note that when ever a value is not explicitly assigned it will be initialized as undefined.
*/
/*Definitions:
    Q: So what does it mean to initialize a variable?
    - A: Initialization is the action of storing a value (data) into a variable.

    Q: What is variable initialization in JavaScript?
    - A: Initialization is the means of assigning an initial value to a variable.

    Q: What is variable initialization?
    - A: Initializing a variable means specifying an initial value to assign it to (i.e. before it is used at all). Hence a variable that is not initialized does can not be used properly, and is actually implicitly initialized as undefined by the JavaScript engine.

    Q: Why do we initialize variables in JavaScript?
    - A: We explicity store values (data) in variables named by their identifiers to provide an idea of their intended use (and int)
*/

// Q: What is variable assignment?
/* Answer:
   - Variable assignment is the action of assigning a value to a variable using the assignment operator `=`. This can happen at anytime during the life time of a variable.
*/
/* Definitions:
  - Variable assignment is the use of a the assignment operator `=` to initialize a variable with a value. (store a value in a variable).
*/

// Q: What is variable re-assignment?
/* Answer:
   - Variable re-assignment is the act of giving a new value or assigning a new value to an existing variable with the use of the assignment operator `=`. 
*/
/* Definitions:

  - The word variable comes from the latin word variƒÅre which means "to make changeable". This is a apt name because the value assigned to a variable can change. The process of reassigning a variable is called reassignment.
