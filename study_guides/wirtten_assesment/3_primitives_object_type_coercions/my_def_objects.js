// Q: What are object types in JavaScript?
// A: Everything that is not a primitive type in JS is an object data type.

// Q: What is considered an object data type?
// A: Objects, Arrays, and Function are actually all objects. Functions are objects too in fact we can set properties and methods on functions. Yes typeof in a function will return function but the Function constructor derives from the Object constructor.

// Q: What are the two structural types?

// Q: What is the biggest difference between primitive types and objects?
/* Answer:

   - primitive types are immutable, objects only have an immutable reference, however an objects value can change over time. 
   
   - primitive types are passed by value. objects are passed by reference.

   - primitive values are copied by value. Objects are copied by reference.

   - primitive data types are compared by value. Objects are compared by reference or pointer
